# **Yet another human guinea pig, promoting polymath lifestyle**

My
aim is to explore the impact of evidence-based practice that has been 
proven to work in the experimental conditions (including but not limited
to socio-psychological experiments, animal testing, and clinical 
trials), but still have a long way to go to be adopted in everyday life 
or in ideal case if they prove to be beneficial, to be accepted as a 
cultural norm in order to improve the quality of living and make the 
world better place. Here, I would like to document my experience and 
solicit the visitor's feedback. Browse around and let me know if you 
like it, or not and why? What works for you and what doesn't?
